# macOS M1/M2/M3 TensorFlow Compatibility Analysis

## Issue
TensorFlow installation fails on macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) when using standard pip installation methods.

## Root Cause
Apple Silicon uses ARM architecture which requires specific TensorFlow builds. The standard TensorFlow package is not compatible with Apple Silicon.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use TensorFlow-macOS
Apple provides a special fork of TensorFlow optimized for Apple Silicon:
```
pip install tensorflow-macos
pip install tensorflow-metal  # For GPU acceleration
```

### Option 2: Use Miniforge with conda
Conda provides optimized builds for Apple Silicon:
```
# Install using conda
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
pip install tensorflow-macos
pip install tensorflow-metal
```

### Option 3: Fallback to CPU-only Mode
Implement a fallback mechanism that uses CPU-only mode when TensorFlow is not available:
```python
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    tf_available = True
except ImportError:
    tf_available = False
    # Use alternative implementation
```

### Option 4: Use Alternative Libraries
Consider alternatives like PyTorch which has better native support for Apple Silicon:
```
pip install torch
```

## Recommendation
1. Update the setup script to detect Apple Silicon and install appropriate packages
2. Modify the model loading code to handle TensorFlow import failures gracefully
3. Provide clear installation instructions for macOS users
4. Implement a fallback to the mock model when TensorFlow is unavailable
